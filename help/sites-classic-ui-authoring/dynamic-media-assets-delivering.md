# Deliver Dynamic Media assets{#delivering-dynamic-media-assets}

How you can deliver your Dynamic Media assets &ndash; both video and images &ndash; depends on how your web site is implemented.

With Dynamic Media, you have several options:

* If your website is hosted on Adobe Experience Manager, then you want to add the Dynamic Media assets directly to your page.
* If your website is not on Experience Manager, then see [Deliver Dynamic Media assets](/help/assets/delivering-dynamic-media-assets.md) in the touch-enabled user interface.

For more information, see the following topics:

* [Add Dynamic Media assets to pages](/help/sites-classic-ui-authoring/dynamic-media-assets-adding-to-page.md)
