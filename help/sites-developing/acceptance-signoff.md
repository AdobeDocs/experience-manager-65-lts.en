# Acceptance and Sign-off{#acceptance-and-sign-off}

As mentioned, [Acceptance Tests](/help/sites-developing/planning.md) are a special category of test used to verify the following:

* The project fulfills the customer's requirements.
* Customer accepts the project.

The customer and project manager should define the requirements. They each have particular significance as they are often related to the final invoicing.

For this reason, the requirements must be:

* Defined as early as possible.
* Updated whenever necessary.
* Both the partner and the customer must formally accept and sign any changes.
