# Adobe Content Package Maven plug-in {#adobe-content-package-maven-plugin}

Use the Adobe Content Package Maven plugin to integrate package deployment and management tasks into your Maven projects.

The Adobe Content Package Maven plug-in deploys the constructed packages to AEM and automates tasks you would normally perform in AEM Package Manager.
