# Code Samples{#code-samples}

The Adobe Consulting Services Team has generated a series of Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) code samples. These samples are well-commented pieces of code to help AEM Developers understand the key building blocks of AEM. The samples are available here: [https://adobe-consulting-services.github.io/acs-aem-samples/](https://adobe-consulting-services.github.io/acs-aem-samples/).

A multi-part tutorial designed for developers new to AEM covering fundamental topics like project setup, Core Components, Editable Templates, Client Libraries, and component development: [Getting Started with AEM Sites - WKND Tutorial](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/getting-started-wknd-tutorial-develop/overview.html)

A Maven template to create an AEM project as a starting point to develop your own functionality is available [on GitHub - AEM Project Archetype](https://github.com/adobe/aem-project-archetype).

Standard, touch-enabled UI code samples are available from [Developing AEM Components](/help/sites-developing/developing-components.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>These code samples are for educational purposes only and should not be deployed on a production instance of AEM.
