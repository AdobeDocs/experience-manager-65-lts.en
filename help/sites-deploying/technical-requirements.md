## Supported Platforms {#supported-platforms}

### Java&trade; Virtual Machines {#java-virtual-machines}

The application requires a Java&trade; Virtual Machine to run, which is provided by the Java&trade; Development Kit (JDK) distribution.

Adobe Experience Manager operates with the following versions of the Java&trade; Virtual Machines:

>[!CAUTION]
>
>Track the Security Bulletins from the Java&trade; vendor. Doing so ensures the safety and security of production environments. Also, always install the latest Java&trade; updates.

| **Platform** | **Support Level** | **Link** |
|---|---|---|
| Oracle Java&trade; SE 17 JDK | A: Supported `[1]` |
| Oracle Java&trade; SE 21 JDK | A: Supported `[1]` |

>For more information, see the [MongoDB for Adobe Experience Manager page](https://www.mongodb.com/lp/contact/mongodb-adobe-experience-manager).

### Servlet Engines / Application Servers {#servlet-engines-application-servers}

Adobe Experience Manager can run either as a stand-alone server (the quickstart JAR file) or as a web application within a third-party application server (the WAR file).

The minimum Servlet API Version required is Servlet 3.1. In addition, AEM supports Jakarta servlet 5 for jar and war can be deployed in application servers implementing Jakarta servlet API 5/6.

| Platform |Support Level |
|---|---|
| **Quickstart built-in Servlet Engine (Jetty 11.0.x)** |A: Supported |
| IBM&reg; WebSphere&reg; Application Server Continuous Delivery (LibertyProfile) with Web Profile 24.0.0.7 and IBM&reg; Sumeru open JRE&reg; 17/21 |R: Restricted Support for new contracts `[1]` |
| Apache Tomcat 10.0.x/10.1.x |R: Restricted Support for new contracts `[1]` |

1. Starting AEM 6.5 deployments on application servers moves to Restricted Support. Existing customers can upgrade to AEM 6.5 and keep using application servers. For new customers, it comes with support criteria and a support program as stated in the Level-R description above.

### Server Operating Systems {#server-operating-systems}

Adobe Experience Manager works with the following server platforms for production environments:

| **Platform** |**Support Level** |
|---|---|
| **Linux&reg;, based on the Red Hat&reg; distribution** |A: Supported `[1]` `[2]` |

1. Linux&reg; Kernel 5. x and 6. x includes derivatives from Red Hat&reg; distribution, including Red Hat&reg; Enterprise Linux&reg;, CentOS, Oracle Linux&reg;, and Amazon Linux&reg;. 
1. Linux&reg; distribution supported by Adobe Managed Services.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >For Linux based server, AEM Forms add-on require runtime dependencies such as:
    >* glibc.x86_64 (2.17-196)
    >* libX11.x86_64 (1.6.7-4)
    >* zlib.x86-64 (1.2.7-17)
    >* libxcb.x86_64 (1.13-1.el7)
    >* libXau.x86_64 (1.0.8-2.1.el7)
    >* glibc-locale.x86_64 (2.17 or later)


### Virtual & Cloud Computing Environments {#virtual-cloud-computing-environments}

Adobe Experience Manager is supported running in a virtual machine on cloud computing environments. These environments include as Microsoft&reg; Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS), running in compliance with the technical requirements listed on this page, and according to Adobe's standard support terms.

For a cloud-native environment, review the latest offering from the AEM product line: Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service. See [Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service Documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service.html) for details.

Adobe also offers Adobe Managed Services to deploy AEM on Azure or AWS. Adobe Managed Services provides experts with experience and skills of deploying and operating AEM in these cloud computing environments. See [additional documentation on Adobe Managed Services](https://business.adobe.com/products/experience-manager/managed-services.html?aemClk=t).

In all other cases of deploying AEM on Azure or AWS, or any other cloud computing environment, support from Adobe is contained to the virtual compute environment. That virtual environment must be run in compliance with the technical specifications listed on this page. Any reported issue relative to AEM running in any of these cloud environments must be reproducible independently from any cloud service specific to the cloud computing environment. That is, unless the cloud service is supported as part of the technical requirements listed on this page, for example, Azure Blob storage or AWS S3.

For recommendations on how to deploy AEM on Azure or AWS, outside of Adobe Managed Services, Adobe recommends working directly with the cloud provider. Or, working with Adobe partners supporting the deployment of AEM in the cloud environment of your choice. The selected cloud provider or partner is responsible for the sizing specifications, design, and implementation of the architecture, to meet your specific performance, load, scalability, and security requirements.

### Dispatcher Platforms (Web Servers) {#dispatcher-platforms-web-servers}

The Dispatcher is the caching and load-balancing component. [Download the latest Dispatcher version](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-dispatcher/using/getting-started/release-notes.html). Experience Manager 6.5 requires Dispatcher version 4.3.2 or higher.

The following web servers are supported for use with Dispatcher version 4.3.2:

| Platform |Support Level |
|---|---|
| **Apache httpd 2.4.x** `[1,2]` |A: Supported |
| Microsoft&reg; IIS 10 (Internet Information Server) |A: Supported |
| Microsoft&reg; IIS 8.5 (Internet Information Server) |Z: Not supported  |

1. Web servers built based on the Apache httpd source code have as much support as the version of httpd on which it is based. If in doubt, ask Adobe for confirmation of the support level related to the respective server product. The following cases:

    1. The HTTP server was built using only official Apache source distributions, or
    1. The HTTP server was delivered as part of the operating system on which it is running. Examples: IBM&reg; HTTP Server, Oracle HTTP Server

1. Dispatcher is not available for Apache 2.4.x for Windows operating systems.

## Supported Client Platforms {#supported-client-platforms}

### Supported Browsers for Authoring User Interface {#supported-browsers-for-authoring-user-interface}

The Adobe Experience Manager user interface works with the following client platforms. All browsers are tested with the default set of plug-ins and add-ons.

The AEM user interface is optimized for larger screens (typically notebooks and desktop computers) and tablet form factor (such as Apple iPad or Microsoft&reg; Surface). The phone form factor is not supported.

>[!NOTE]
>
>**Support for browsers with rapid release cycles:**
>
>Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Microsoft&reg; Edge release updates every few months. Adobe is committed to provide updates for Adobe Experience Manager to maintain the support level as stated below with upcoming versions of these browsers.

1. Extended Support Release of Firefox [Learn more on mozilla.org](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/enterprise/)
1. Support for Apple iPad

### Supported Browsers for Websites {#supported-browsers-for-websites}

Generally, browser support for websites rendered by AEM Sites depends on the implementation of AEM page templates, design and component output, and is therefore in the control of the party implementing these parts.

## Additional Platform Notes {#additional-platform-notes}

This section provides special notes and more detailed information about running Adobe Experience Manager and its add-ons.

### IPv4 and IPv6 {#ipv-and-ipv}

All elements of Adobe Experience Manager (Instance, Dispatcher) can be installed in both IPv4 and IPv6 networks.

Operation is seamless as no special configuration is required. You specify an IP address using the format that is appropriate to your network type, if necessary.

When an IP address must be specified, you can select (as required) from the following:

* An IPv6 address. For example, `https://[ab12::34c5:6d7:8e90:1234]:4502`

* An IPv4 address. For example, `https://123.1.1.4:4502`

* A server name. For example, `https://www.yourserver.com:4502`

* The default case of `localhost` is interpreted for both IPv4 and IPv6 network installations. For example, `https://localhost:4502`

### Requirements for AEM Dynamic Media Add-on {#requirements-for-aem-dynamic-media-add-on}

AEM Dynamic Media is disabled by default. See here to [enable Dynamic Media](/help/assets/config-dynamic.md#enabling-dynamic-media).

With Dynamic Media enabled, the following additional technical requirements apply.

>[!NOTE]
>
>These system requirements **only** apply if you use Dynamic Media - Hybrid mode; Dynamic Media - Hybrid mode has an embedded image server, which is only certified on certain operating systems.
>
>For Dynamic Media customers who run Dynamic Media - Scene7 mode (that is, **dynamicmedia_scene7** run mode), there are no additional system requirements; only the same system requirements as AEM. Dynamic Media - Scene7 mode architecture uses the cloud-based image service and not the service embedded in AEM.

#### Hardware {#hardware}

The following hardware requirements are applicable for both Linux&reg; and Windows:

* Intel Xeon&reg; or AMD&reg; Opteron CPU with at least four cores
* At least 16 GB of RAM

#### Linux&reg; {#linux}

If you are using Dynamic Media on Linux&reg;, the following prerequisites must be met:

* Red Hat&reg; Enterprise 7 or CentOS 7 and later with latest fix patches
* 64-bit Operating System
* Swapping disabled (recommended)
* SELinux disabled (See note that follows)

>[!NOTE]
>
>If the locale is set such that LC_CTYPE is not equal to `en_US.UTF-8`, it prevents Dynamic Media from working. To see what its value is, type "locale" at the command prompt. If it is not set properly, then set the LC_CTYPE environment variable to the empty string by typing "export LC_CTYPE=" before running AEM.

>[!NOTE]
>
>**Disabling SELinux:** Image Serving does not work with SELinux turned on. This option is enabled by default. To remedy this issue, edit the **/etc/selinux/config** file and change the SELinux value from:
>
>`SELINUX=enforcing` **to** `SELINUX=disabled`

>[!NOTE]
>
>**NUMA Architecture:** Systems with processors featuring AMD64 and Intel&reg; EM64T are typically configured as non-uniform memory architecture (NUMA) platforms. That is, the kernel constructs multiple memory nodes at boot-time rather than constructing a single memory node.
>
>The multiple node construct can result in memory exhaustion on one or more of the nodes before other nodes become exhausted. When memory exhaustion happens the kernel can decide to kill processes (for example, the Image Server or Platform Server) even though there is available memory.
>
>Therefore, Adobe recommends that if you are running such a system that you turn off NUMA using the **numa=off** boot option to avoid the kernel killing these processes.

>[!NOTE]
>
>**Server host name must resolve:** Ensure that the host name of the server is resolvable to an IP address. If that is not possible, add the fully qualified host name and the IP address to **/etc/hosts**:
>
>`<ip address> <fully qualified hostname>`

#### Windows {#windows}

* Microsoft&reg; Windows Server 2016
* Swap space equal to at least twice the amount of physical memory (RAM)

* Microsoft Visual C++ 2019 (VC 14.28 or greater) 64-bit runtime for 64-bit AEM Forms Designer

[Install and configure AEM Forms designer](/help/forms/using/installing-configuring-designer.md)

### Requirements for AEM Assets XMP metadata write-back {#requirements-for-aem-assets-xmp-metadata-write-back}

XMP write-back is supported and enabled for the following platforms and file formats:

* **Operating Systems:**

  * Linux&reg; (32-bit and 32-bit application support on 64-bit systems).
  * Windows Server
  * macOS X (64-bit)

* **File Formats**: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, PDF, INDD, AI, and EPS.

### Requirements for AEM Assets to process metadata-heavy assets on Linux&reg; {#assetsonlinux}

The XMPFilesProcessor process requires the library GLIBC_2.14 to work. Use a Linux&reg; kernel that contains GLIBC_2.14, for example, Linux&reg; kernel version 3.1.x. It improves performance for processing assets that contain a large amount of metadata, like PSD files. Using a previous version of GLIBC leads to error in logs starting with `com.day.cq.dam.core.impl.handler.xmp.NCommXMPHandler Failed to read XMP`.
