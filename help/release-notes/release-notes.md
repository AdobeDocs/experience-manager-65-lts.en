This improvement enhances accessibility compliance and improves the experience for users relying on assistive technologies. (SITES-26881)
* Corrected invalid ARIA attributes in Coral UI components. Updated Coral UI components to ensure all ARIA attributes use valid values, improving accessibility-compliance. In particular, cases were addressed where invalid values like `aria-modal="dialog"` were incorrectly assigned. This enhancement enables screen readers to interpret dialog box elements correctly, improving accessibility for users relying on assistive technologies. (SITES-26873)

* Updated the References Rail to use relative units for sizing and positioning, enabling content to scale and remain fully functional when zoomed to 400% at a 1280x1024 viewport. (SITES-24972) 
* Confirmed table elements in the Sites Home Page List View contain proper column header roles, enabling screen readers to announce headers for each data cell. (SITES-24942)
* NVDA now announces the Modified date in the Tree Directory, ensuring screen reader users receive complete asset detail information. (SITES-24782) 
* Fixed issue where the NVDA screen reader announced incomplete text for items in the Tree Directory component in AEM Sites. NVDA now reads full text for each item, improving accessibility and compliance. (SITES-24780)

* Removed incorrect `aria-label` attributes from non-interactive static elements in the List View to prevent screen readers from announcing misleading or irrelevant information. (SITES-24515) 
* Updated the checkbox in the first column of the List View to use the Title column text for its accessible name, ensuring screen readers accurately convey the purpose of the form field. (SITES-24514) 
* Added proper ARIA attributes and live region support to announce loading status messages to screen reader users when navigating through content. (SITES-24481) 
* Updated responsive design to eliminate horizontal scrolling when content is zoomed to 400% with a viewport width of 1280×1024, ensuring full visibility without side scrolling. (SITES-24308) 
* Corrected focus navigation in the Sites Admin UI to follow a logical order, returning focus to the "Select All" button after pressing Esc and moving focus to the next interactive element after pressing Tab. (SITES-24307) 
* Updated focus order in the Sites Admin UI so the breadcrumbs button in the `<betty-titlebar-title>` element receives focus in the correct sequence during keyboard navigation. (SITES-24305) 
* Verified skip link functionality to ensure it moves keyboard focus to the main content area, allowing keyboard users to bypass header elements and access content efficiently. (SITES-24061) 


#### Classic user interface{#sites-classicui-65-lts-sp1} 

Fixed an issue in Classic UI where checkbox labels were missing and HTML displayed as encoded text in multiple UI elements, including Date Search and non-standard interfaces. (SITES-31822) 

#### [!DNL Content Fragments]{#sites-contentfragments-65-lts-sp1}

AEM now prevents performance degradation caused by malformed XMP metadata in image assets. Assets that contain invalid or non-compliant XMP property names, such as those with numeric segments or unqualified structures, no longer trigger repeated warning logs during processing. The system filters out problematic metadata to ensure that asset ingestion and validation is complete without errors. (SITES-30683)

<!--
#### [!DNL Content Fragments] - Admin{#sites-admin-65-lts-sp1} -->

#### [!DNL Content Fragments] - Fragments editor{#sites-fragments-editor-65-lts-sp1}

Other authors can still publish Content Fragments even when another author checks them out, which is contrary to the intended behavior of the checkout feature. This fix prevents other users from seeing or using the publish buttons in the authoring interface when a Content Fragment is checked out. (SITES-30578)

<!--
#### [!DNL Content Fragments] - GraphQL API {#sites-graphql-api-65-lts-sp1}

#### Core backend{#sites-core-backend-65-lts-sp1}

Improperly formatted XMP metadata triggered an error during processing of image assets in the `ValidationDataServlet`. The fix ensures compliant metadata handling and avoids redundant parsing of invalid properties. (SITE-30683)

* Fixed an issue in the Demographics Toolbar where adjusting the Cart Slider with keyboard input moved focus to the Cart button instead of retaining focus on the slider, improving navigation efficiency for keyboard users. (SITES-25324) 
* Added an accessible name to the Cart Slider in the Demographics Toolbar by assigning a value to its associated `<label>` element. This fix improved compatibility with assistive technologies and enhancing usability for screen reader users. (SITES-25322) 
* Added ARIA roles and accessible names to buttons inside the Demographics Toolbar drop-down. This fix enabled proper identification by assistive technologies and improved navigation for keyboard and screen reader users. (SITES-25315) 
* Adjusted the Demographic Toolbar layout to prevent content overflow beyond the viewport at 200% browser zoom, ensuring all controls remain accessible without horizontal scrolling. (SITES-25309) 
* Corrected focus management in the Demographic Toolbar to keep keyboard focus on the activated button instead of resetting focus to the toolbar's starting position. (SITES-25306) 
* The button label overlap functions as designed, using a tooltip to display the label when modes with similar screen widths are active. (SITES-25285) 
* The annotation modal includes a visible submit button, allowing users to submit annotations without relying on the Escape key or clicking outside the modal. (SITES-25281) 
* The annotation modal includes a pen icon button that allows users to submit annotations, providing a clear and accessible submission method. (SITES-25269) 
* Corrected screen reader announcements for the Annotate and Close Annotate buttons to provide accurate, relevant feedback and remove unrelated or confusing information. (SITES-25268)

* Removed unnecessary horizontal scrolling in the Carousel Modal at 320px width to ensure all content displays within the viewport without requiring side-to-side navigation. (SITES-25254) 
* Removed unnecessary horizontal scrolling in the Image Modal at 320px width to ensure all content displays within the viewport without requiring side-to-side navigation. (SITES-25244) 
* Removed unnecessary horizontal scrolling in the Teaser Modal at 320px width to ensure all content displays within the viewport without requiring side-to-side navigation. (SITES-25242) 
* Enabled keyboard navigation for the `List` and `Paragraph Format` pop-up menu, both in the Teaser Modal. This fix allows users to access and navigate these menus using arrow keys. (SITES-25235) 
* Corrected screen reader announcements for the Annotate and Close Annotate buttons to provide accurate, relevant feedback aligned with the associated actions. (SITES-25234) 
* Improved the Help button label in the Teaser Modal to describe its purpose clearly and provide meaningful context for all users, including assistive technology users. (SITES-25224) 
* Improved the emulator ruler for screen reader users by associating ruler measurements with their respective devices. Also, replacing the tooltip with an aria-describedby element. (SITES-24955) 
* No fix was implemented because the Edit button functions as intended and provides informational context rather than performing an action. (SITES-24950) 
* Confirmed focus order on the Editor page follows a logical sequence, allowing users to navigate through all interactive elements without skipping or looping back unexpectedly. (SITES-24937) 
* Confirmed Preview mode canvas updates text spacing correctly when users apply custom text spacing settings, ensuring consistent formatting across all content areas. (SITES-24936)

## Forms

### Forms Designer

* When a user exports the data for an XFA-based PDF using the exportDataAPI, the resulting XML shows discrepancies when compared with the XML data exported manually using Acrobat Reader. Values of some fields were missing in the output compared to the output generated from Acrobat Reader. (LC-3922791)
* Generating a tagged PDF with the Output Service in Workbench adds an unexpected label tag under the reference tag in a table of contents item. (LC-3922756)
* When flattening dynamic, fillable PDFs to PDF/A format using the Output Service, the dynamic state is not preserved. This issue leads to data loss and potential compliance issues, especially when tagging is enabled. (LC-3922708)
* When a user places field captions with bottom or right alignment in AEM Forms Designer, the tag tree includes only the caption without the corresponding value, leading to incomplete accessibility tagging. (LC-3922619)
* The QR codes in generated PDFs become unreadable. The alternative text for the QR codes also fails accessibility testing, affecting screen reader compatibility. (LC-3922551)
* When a user renders a letter in Agent UI, the content fails to display correctly due to the FormService render() API. (LC-3922461)
* When a user tries to create PDF/A files from XDPs with Sunken Square style in AEM Forms, it results in border rendering issues. (LC-3922180)
* Flattening dynamic forms bound to an XSD schema causes partial data loss, as some bound form data is not retained in the final PDF. (LC-3922008)
* When a user tries to export data from interactive PDFs using the extractData API in AEM Forms 6.5.13 and later versions, it results in missing data compared to manual export. (LC-3921983)
* Converting XDP forms to static PDFs with AEM Forms Designer or the Output service creates multiple `Link-OBJR` tags. The issues cause an accessibility compliance issue because a single unified link tag is expected. (LC-3921977)

### Adaptive Forms

* In AEM Forms, enabling "Allow Rich Text for Title" on the root panel causes "Exclude Title from Document of Record" on a nested panel to hide the root panel's title incorrectly. It does so in the generated Document of Record. (FORMS-19696)
* The system ignores the custom `sling:resourceType` assigned through `aem:afProperties` in a JSON schema. The custom resource type is ignored during rendering. (FORMS-19691)
* When a user submits an Adaptive Form with prefilled attachments using URIs, the form submission fails with a NullPointerException due to missing binary data. (FORMS-19371) (FORMS-19486)
* When a user uploads a PDF under the 'Forms and Documents' section, the timeline feature stops functioning. (FORMS-19407)(FORMS-19234)
* When a user uploads files using the out-of-the-box (OOTB) file attachment component in AEM Forms, security vulnerabilities are identified. The issue leads to potential interception of the submission process by unauthorized entities. (FORMS-19271)
* When a user configures an out-of-the-box Adaptive Form in AEM Forms to generate a Document of Record (DoR) automatically, the "Title" field in Acrobat Reader's Document Properties does not display the captured DoR title. By default, the form title does not appear in place of the filename. (FORMS-19263)
* When a user opens an Interactive Communication in Agent UI, the prefilled data cannot be completely erased; upon removal, it automatically refills with the same data. (FORMS-19151)
* When a user previews a date field in the Agent UI, the date unexpectedly changes. The issue occurs due to time zone discrepancies between the VM's UTC setting and the system's interpretation of the date. (FORMS-19115)
* When a user submits a form, file attachments may duplicate, leading to multiple uploads of the same file. (FORMS-19045)(FORMS-19051)
* Adding coordinators to policy sets in Document Security fails across both production and lower environments. (FORMS-18603, FORMS-18212, FORMS-19697)
* When a user clicks the "datepicker-calendar-icon" in desktop mode with an empty field, an error occurs due to the undefined _$focusedDate variable, disrupting associated custom scripts. (FORMS-18483)(FORMS-18268)
* When a customer previews a letter, the 'Amount in words' field fails to display or update number values incorrectly, leading to misalignment and missing spaces in the content. (FORMS-18437, FORMS-17330, FORMS-18209, FORMS-18557, CTG-4150848,FORMS-19614, LC-3922004)
* When a customer previews a saved letter on RHEL, the content misaligns, spaces are missing, and unexpected characters like 'x' appear. (FORMS-18422)(FORMS-17641)
* When a user navigates between tabs in AEM Forms, selecting components on the first tab becomes unresponsive. (FORMS-18345)
* When a user converts an HTML file to PDF using the WebToPDF option, the output PDF is missing the header section, including metadata and title tags. (FORMS-18223, FORMS-17835, FORMS-19642, FORMS-18224)
* In the AEM JEE Process Manager SDK, when a user invokes the retryAction(long actionOid) method, the system incorrectly retries the first action found in the tb_action_instance table. This workflow occurs even when a specific action ID is provided or when the ID is null, resulting in unintended behavior. (FORMS-18187)
* A user encounters issues where the saved draft and submission functionalities fail without displaying any error message. (FORMS-18069)
* Transitioning from XSD-based Foundation Components to Core Components prevents the implementation of cross-file references in JSON schemas, impacting Adaptive Forms migration. (FORMS-18065)
* When a user previews a letter in the Agent UI, the date field shows an incorrect value due to IC time conversion issues. These discrepancies arise from time zone differences between the VM environment and the system's interpretation of time (UTC versus local time). (FORMS-17988) (FORMS-17248)
* When a user previews letters using Notice IC templates in AEM Forms, PDF generation times vary significantly, from 1.5 seconds to more than 10 seconds, even on the same server. This inconsistency affects business critical workflows. (FORMS-17951)
* When a user binds a Scribble Signature object in an Adaptive Form to an XDP using the 'Data Sources' option, changes cannot be saved. The reason is due to persistent aspect ratio validation errors, even when using valid values. (FORMS-17587)
* When a user uses a specific XDP with many hidden fields for document fragments, AEM creates CRX nodes with the `cm:optional` property set to false, which causes the Interactive Communication (IC) submission to fail. (FORMS-17538)
* When a customer previews a letter, the numeric box field fails to handle negative values correctly when digit limits for Lead and Frac are defined. This issue occurs due to the use of parseFloat, which treats the minus sign as part of the number. (FORMS-17451)
* When a letter is previewed, the use of the "*" wildcard in the Adobe.json file is noticed, raising concern about its purpose and potential modification. (FORMS-17317)
* When a user uses a screen reader on the Apply for a Fixed Rate Saver joint account the headings are incorrectly announced as clickable, causing accessibility issues. (FORMS-17038)
* When a form is embedded, the generated iframe is missing a title attribute, leading to an accessibility compliance issue. (FORMS-17010)
* Downloading a form using the Forms Manager UI always includes associated dependencies, such as themes and fragments. (FORMS-15811)
* When a user accesses the form on mobile devices (iOS and Android&trade;), the 'next' and 'previous' buttons on the first page are disabled. However, the screen reader does not identify them as disabled. (FORMS-15773)
* When a user saves a large form with fragments and lazy loading enabled, it fails to retrieve drafts, disrupting the workflow. (FORMS-19890, FORMS-19808)
* Users experienced issues saving form properties for Adaptive Form based on Core Components. This error occurred because redundant scripts from the Adaptive Form based on Foundation Components editor are included, causing conflicts in the Adaptive Form based on Core Components. editor. (FORMS-17474)
* Users experienced issues with the Adobe Sign GovCloud Signature page not rendering in an iframe. (FORMS-16803)
* Users experienced errors when selecting references for Core Component Adaptive Forms (AF) fragments. The error message "Unable to render reference: Not an absolute path" appeared, preventing proper reference rendering. (FORMS-19678)
* Added support for multi-threaded conversion with Acrobat DC, enabling users to perform simultaneous Word, Excel, and PowerPoint document conversions to PDF documents more efficiently. (FORMS-21310)
* Added inclusion of `com.adobe.granite.toggle.impl.dev` bundle in AEM Service Pack 24, enabling more streamlined development processes by removing it from the Forms add-on. (FORMS-20139)
* Removed FeatureToggleRenderConditionServlet from forms-foundation and com.adobe.granite.toggle.impl.dev bundle from forms add-on. This update ensures that after forms add-on installation, the render condition resolves correctly, improving component functionality for customers. (FORMS-20138)
* Users experienced slow performance due to long-running queries in Adaptive Forms. This update backports query changes to improve efficiency. Customers can now create an index with the tag name aemformsAFReferences. (FORMS-21411)
* Users experienced misaligned header positions when converting HTML to Portable Document Format (PDF) using WebtoPDF. This issue affected consistency in document layout and readability of output. (FORMS-21502, FORMS-21540)
* Users experienced PDF/A-1b validation failures despite successful PreFlight verification. This issue affected document compliance checks for enterprise customers using PDF validation tools. (FORMS-20196)
* Users experienced untranslated strings in the UI, causing confusion and difficulty in understanding the interface. (FORMS-6542)
* Users experienced issues with email notifications. The Send Email Workflow Step failed to send emails, impacting automated communication processes. (FORMS-17961)
* Users experienced failing tests for forms workflows, which impacted their ability to complete workflow processes efficiently. (FORMS-16231)
* Users were unable to use the timeline feature of PDF files in AEM forms. This issue affected users' ability to track document changes and revisions effectively. When uploading any PDF under the 'Forms and Documents' section in the AEM forms area, the timeline view ceases to function. (FORMS-19408)
* Users experience a null pointer exception when interacting with OData. This cause interruptions in data retrieval processes. (FORMS-20348)
* Removed the google.common.collect library following the removal of Guava, an open-source Java library. This update ensures better compatibility and performance for enterprise customers using Adaptive Forms. (FORMS-17031)

### Forms Captcha

* Added `Hcaptcha` and `Turnstile` support for Adaptive Forms based on Foundation Components. (FORMS-16562)
* Users experienced icon overlap issues in the `Create hCaptcha Configuration` dialog box. When filling required fields, the information icon overlapped the error icon, causing confusion during configuration setup. (FORMS-16916)
* Users experienced incorrect configuration being picked up for reCAPTCHA in Adaptive Forms based on Foundation Components. When the configuration container was not selected for a form, multiple configurations in the `conf/global` folder caused the issue. (FORMS-19237)
* Users experienced issues with reCAPTCHA not being rendered. This affected form submissions and security validation for enterprise customers. (FORMS-17136, FORMS-19596)
* Users experience an issue where the size of reCAPTCHA enterprise is not reflected in the User Interface (UI). (FORMS-16574)
* Users experienced issues with the ReCaptcha functionality due to an unclosed ResourceResolver in `ReCaptchaConfigurationServiceImpl`, causing intermittent validation failures during form submissions. (FORMS-19241)
* Users experienced issues with reCAPTCHA validation when forms are authored in Sites. AEM forms did not recognize the form name correctly, causing validation failures. (FORMS-20486)
* Users experienced form submissions even when the enterprise reCAPTCHA score was 1.0, leading to potential security risks. (FORMS-16766){{$include }}
* Improved reCAPTCHA alerting in Adaptive Forms by updating submit error codes to 400. Also, refined log alerts to distinguish between timeouts, expirations, and bot detection failures, enhancing troubleshooting accuracy and system observability. (FORMS-19240)
* Closed an unclosed ResourceResolver instance in ReCaptchaConfigurationServiceImpl to prevent potential resource leaks and improve system stability when using reCAPTCHA integrations in AEM Forms. (FORMS-19242)
* Improved CAPTCHA configuration handling for AEM Forms by ensuring the correct configuration binds to each form when multiple entries exist in the /conf/global folder. Prevents unintended use of incorrect CAPTCHA settings when the configuration container is not explicitly selected. (FORMS-19239)

### Forms Management UI

* Users experienced unlocalized strings in the `Forms` > `Create Watchfolder` >` Watchfolder` creation process. When creating a watched folder, strings such as `Watchfolder creation` and `Watchfolder created successfully` were not found, affecting the User Interface experience. (FORMS-15234)

#### Best practices for AEM 6.5 LTS Service Pack upgrades

<!-- THE INFORMATION UNDER THIS HEADING CAME FROM CQDOC-23078 -->

**Environment**
Applies to: AEM 6.5 LTS (On-Premise) customers installing Service Pack 1 (SP1). SP1 is delivered as a Quickstart JAR.

**Why this matters**
SP1 for AEM 6.5 LTS ships as a Quickstart JAR rather than a ZIP to install through Package Manager. On-prem customers upgrade by replacing the Quickstart JAR, unpacking it, and restarting. This method is consistent with Adobe's in-place upgrade procedure.

**Recommended upgrade flow (Author or Publish)**

1. Verify your AEM 6.5 LTS instance is healthy and accessible.
1. Download the SP1 Quickstart JAR (for example, `cq-quickstart-6.6.x.jar`) from Software Distribution. 
1. Stop the running instance. 
1. In the AEM install directory (outside `crx-quickstart/`), replace the previous Quickstart JAR with the SP1 JAR.
1. Unpack the JAR:

    ```java
    java -jar cq-quickstart-6.6.x.jar -unpack
    ```

    (Adjust heap flags as needed.)

1. Rename the unpacked JAR to match the role and port, for example `cq-author-4502.jar` or `cq-publish-4503.jar`.
1. Start AEM and confirm the upgrade in the UI (Help > About) and logs.

**Good hygiene**

* Run the upgrade in lower/test environments before production.
* Take full, restorable backups (repository plus any external datastores) before you begin.
* Review Adobe's in-place upgrade guidance and technical requirements (Java 17/21 recommended for LTS).

>[!NOTE]
>
>File names shown above (for example, `cq-quickstart-6.6.x.jar`) reflect the SP1 Quickstart artifact naming observed for this LTS release; always use the exact file name you download from Software Distribution. 

## Install and update {#install-update}

For setup requirements, see [installation instructions](/help/sites-deploying/custom-standalone-install.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
> If you are directly upgrading to LTS SP1 from old 6.5 SPs, please follow the instructions given for 6.5 to 6.5 LTS GA [upgrade](/help/sites-deploying/upgrade.md).


For detailed instructions, see the [upgrade documentation](/help/sites-deploying/upgrade.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
> For fresh AEM 6.5 LTS installations, index definitions must be installed separately. For more information, see [this article](/help/sites-deploying/pre-upgrade-maintenance-tasks.md#index-definitions).

## Deprecated and removed features {#deprecated-and-removed-features}

<!-- CARRY OVER EACH RELEASE -->

Adobe continually reviews product capabilities to improve customer value by modernizing or replacing older features. These changes are made with careful attention to backward compatibility.

To communicate the impending removal or replacement of Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) capabilities, the following rules apply:

1. Announcement of deprecation comes first. While deprecated, capabilities are still available but are not further enhanced.
1. Removal of deprecated capabilities occurs in the following major release at the earliest. The actual target date for removal is planned for announcement later.

This process gives customers at least one release cycle to adapt their implementation to a new version or successor of a deprecated capability, before actual removal.

### Deprecated features {#deprecated-features}

This section lists features and capabilities that Adobe has deprecated in AEM 6.5 LTS. Typically, Adobe deprecates features before removing them in a future release and provides an alternative.


Customers are advised to review if they use the feature/capability in their current deployment, and make plans to change their implementation to use the alternative provided.
