## [!DNL Experience Manager Foundation] {#experience-manager-foundation}

The platform of [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] 6.5 LTS builds on top of updated versions of the OSGi-based framework (Apache Sling and Apache Felix) and the Java&trade; Content Repository: Apache Jackrabbit Oak 1.68.x.

Eclipse Jetty 11.0.x is used as a servlet engine for the Quickstart.

### Java&trade; support  {#java-support}

* Support for Java&trade; 17 and Java&trade; 21.
* For optimal performance, override the default GC values with other values. For more information, see the [install and update](/help/sites-deploying/custom-standalone-install.md) section.
* Adobe distributes Java&trade; 17  and Java&trade; 21 maintenance updates for customer usage in AEM-related projects, when not publicly available from Oracle.

### Uberjar packaging {#uber-jar-packaging}

* There is a slight difference in Uberjar packaging of AEM 6.5 LTS. For more information, see [Update the AEM Uber Jar version](/help/sites-deploying/upgrading-code-and-customizations.md#update-the-aem-uber-jar-version).

### Upgrade {#upgrade}

* For details about the upgrade procedure, see the [upgrade documentation](/help/sites-deploying/upgrade.md).
* For detailed upgrade instructions, see the [Upgrade Guide for AEM Forms 6.5 LTS SP1 on JEE](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-65-lts/content/forms/upgrade-aem-forms/upgrade)

#### Best practices for AEM 6.5 LTS Service Pack upgrades

<!-- THE INFORMATION UNDER THIS HEADING CAME FROM CQDOC-23078 -->

**Environment**
Applies to: AEM 6.5 LTS (On-Premise) customers installing Service Pack 1 (SP1). SP1 is delivered as a Quickstart JAR.

**Why this matters**
SP1 for AEM 6.5 LTS ships as a Quickstart JAR rather than a ZIP to install through Package Manager. On-prem customers upgrade by replacing the Quickstart JAR, unpacking it, and restarting. This method is consistent with Adobe's in-place upgrade procedure.

**Recommended upgrade flow (Author or Publish)**

1. Verify that your AEM 6.5 LTS instance is healthy and accessible.
1. Download the SP1 Quickstart JAR (for example, `cq-quickstart-6.6.x.jar`) from Software Distribution. 
1. Stop the running instance. 
1. In the AEM install directory (outside `crx-quickstart/`), replace the previous Quickstart JAR with the SP1 JAR.
1. Unpack the JAR:

    ```java
    java -jar cq-quickstart-6.6.x.jar -unpack
    ```

    (Adjust heap flags as needed.)

1. Rename the unpacked JAR to match the role and port, for example `cq-author-4502.jar` or `cq-publish-4503.jar`.
1. Start AEM and confirm the upgrade in the UI (Help > About) and logs.

**Good hygiene**

* Run the upgrade in lower/test environments before production.
* Take a full, restorable backup (repository plus any external datastores) before you begin.
* Review Adobe's in-place upgrade guidance and technical requirements (Java 17/21 recommended for LTS).

>[!NOTE]
>
>File names shown above (for example, `cq-quickstart-6.6.x.jar`) reflect the SP1 Quickstart artifact naming observed for this LTS release; always use the exact file name you download from Software Distribution. 

## Install and update {#install-update}

For setup requirements, see [installation instructions](/help/sites-deploying/custom-standalone-install.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
> If you are directly upgrading to LTS SP1 from old 6.5 SPs, please follow the instructions given for 6.5 to 6.5 LTS GA [upgrade](/help/sites-deploying/upgrade.md).


For detailed instructions, see the [upgrade documentation](/help/sites-deploying/upgrade.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
> For fresh AEM 6.5 LTS installations, index definitions must be installed separately. For more information, see [this article](/help/sites-deploying/pre-upgrade-maintenance-tasks.md#index-definitions).

## Install and update AEM Forms add-on {#install-update-aem-forms-add-on}

For detailed instructions, see [Performing an In-Place Upgrade](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-65/content/release-notes/aem-forms-current-service-pack-installation-instructions).

>[!NOTE]
>
>Java&trade; 17/Java&trade; 21 are the recommended versions to use with AEM 6.5 LTS.


## Deprecated and removed features {#deprecated-and-removed-features}

<!-- CARRY OVER EACH RELEASE -->

Adobe continually reviews and evolves product capabilities to deliver greater customer value by modernizing or replacing legacy features. These changes are implemented with careful consideration for backward compatibility.

To ensure transparency and allow adequate planning, Adobe follows this deprecation process for Adobe Experience Manager (AEM):

* Deprecation is announced first. Deprecated capabilities remain available but are no longer enhanced.

* Removal occurs no earlier than the next major release. The planned removal timeline is communicated separately.

* A minimum of one release cycle is provided for customers to transition to supported alternatives before a capability is removed.

### Deprecated features {#deprecated-features}

This section lists features and capabilities that Adobe has deprecated in AEM 6.5 LTS. Typically, Adobe deprecates features before removing them in a future release and provides an alternative.

Customers are advised to review if they use the feature/capability in their current deployment, and make plans to change their implementation to use the alternative provided.

| Area | Feature | Replacement | Version (SP) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sites | [SPA Editor](/help/sites-developing/spa-overview.md) | The preferred editors for managing headless content in AEM are:<br>- [The Universal Editor](/help/sites-developing/universal-editor/introduction.md) for visual editing.<br>- [The Content Fragment Editor](/help/assets/content-fragments/content-fragments-managing.md) for form-based editing. | 6.5 LTS GA |

### Removed features {#removed-features}

This section lists features and capabilities that have been removed from AEM 6.5 LTS. Prior releases had these capabilities marked as deprecated.

## Known issues {#known-issues} 

### Dispatcher connection failure with SSL-only feature (Fixed in AEM 6.5 LTS SP1 and later){#ssl-only-feature}

>[!NOTE]
>
> This issue is only present in the AEM 6.5 LTS GA release.

When enabling the SSL-only feature in AEM deployments, there is a known issue that affects connectivity between the Dispatcher and AEM instances. After enabling this feature, health checks may fail and communication between Dispatcher and AEM instances can be disrupted. This issue specifically occurs when customers attempt to connect through `https + IP` from the Dispatcher to AEM instances. It is related to SNI (Server Name Indication) validation problems.

**Impact**

* Health check failures with HTTP 400 response codes
* Broken traffic between Dispatcher and AEM instances
* Content cannot be properly served through the Dispatcher
* Connection failures when using HTTPS with IP addresses in Dispatcher configuration
* HTTP 400 "Invalid SNI" errors when connecting via HTTPS + IP

**Affected environments**

* AEM deployments with Dispatcher configurations
* Systems where the SSL-only feature has been enabled
* Dispatcher configurations using `https + IP` connection method to AEM instances

**Solution**

If you experience this issue, please contact Adobe Customer Support. A hotfix [cq-6.5.lts.0-hotfix-CQ-4359803](https://experience.adobe.com/#/downloads/content/software-distribution/en/aem.html?package=/content/software-distribution/en/details.html/content/dam/aem/public/adobe/packages/cq660/hotfixes/cq-6.5.lts.0-hotfix-CQ-4359803-1.0.2.zip) is available to resolve this problem. Do not attempt to enable SSL-only features until applying the necessary hotfix.
