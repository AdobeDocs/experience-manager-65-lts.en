# Current Release Notes for Adobe Experience Manager 6.5.2025{#release-notes}

## Deprecated and Removed Features {#deprecated-and-removed-features}

Adobe constantly evaluates product capabilities, to over time reinvent or replace older features with more modern alternatives to improve overall customer value, always under careful consideration of backward compatibility.

To communicate the impending removal or replacement of Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) capabilities, the following rules apply:

1. Announcement of deprecation comes first. While deprecated, capabilities are still available but are not further enhanced.
1. Removal of deprecated capabilities occurs in the following major release at the earliest. Actual target date for removal will be announced later.

This process gives customers at least one release cycle to adapt their implementation to a new version or successor of a deprecated capability, before actual removal.

### Deprecated features {#deprecated-features}

This section lists features and capabilities that have been marked as deprecated with AEM 6.5. Generally, features that are planned for removal in a future release are set to deprecated first, with an alternative provided.

Customers are advised to review if they use the feature/capability in their current deployment, and make plans to change their implementation to use the alternative provided.
