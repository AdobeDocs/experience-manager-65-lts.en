For forms that are rendered as HTML, form validation errors that occur are displayed for the user. You can customize how validation messages are displayed. Depending on where the validation messages are displayed, you can also control the location of the message in the form and the size of the frame border.

## Specify how validation messages are displayed {#specify-how-validation-messages-are-displayed}

1. In administration console, click Services &gt; forms.
1. Under Validation Output, in the Reporting list, select one of the following options:

   **Message box:** To display validation messages in a separate dialog box.

   **Frame:** To display validation messages within a frame of the same window.

   **No Frame:** To display validation messages in the same window. This value is the default.

   **Via API (with data):** To return the validation messages through the API (with data). The validation messages are not displayed on the screen.

   **Via API (with form):** To return the validation messages through the API (with the form). The validation messages are not displayed on the screen.

   **None:** To not display validation messages.

1. Click Save.

## Specify the location of validation messages relative to the form returned in the web browser {#specify-the-location-of-validation-messages-relative-to-the-form-returned-in-the-web-browser}

## Specify the frame border size {#specify-the-frame-border-size}

When Reporting is set to Frame, you can specify the frame border size.

   The border size must be equal to or greater than 0. The default value is 1.
